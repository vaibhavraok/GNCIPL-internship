## 📁 Projects Included
**1. Disease Diagnosis Accuracy (Week 1)**

**Domain:** Medical Science
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Dataset:** UCI Machine Learning Repository – Disease Diagnosis Accuracy

**Description:**
Evaluated diagnostic accuracy of various medical tests using classification and evaluation metrics. The project focused on quantifying false positives, false negatives, sensitivity, and specificity for disease diagnosis.

**Highlights:**

- Preprocessed patient medical test results

- Built confusion matrix to evaluate predictions

- Generated ROC curves to compare test effectiveness

- Analyzed false positive and false negative rates

- Derived insights for improving diagnostic reliability

**2. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Week 2)**

**Domain:** Finance / Cybersecurity
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PCA
**Dataset:** Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection (Anonymized Transaction Data)

**Description:**
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a highly imbalanced transaction dataset to detect fraudulent activities. Focused on anomaly detection, outlier patterns, and clustering of suspicious transactions.

**Highlights:**

- Cleaned anonymized credit card transaction data

- Explored outlier trends and correlations in fraud vs non-fraud transactions

- Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization

- Used heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots to identify fraud-related anomalies

- Derived actionable insights into fraudulent behavior patterns

**3. E-commerce User Behavior Segmentation (Week 3)**

**Domain:** E-commerce / Customer Analytics
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Hierarchical Clustering
**Dataset:** UCI Online Retail Dataset

**Description:**
Implemented customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user purchase behavior. The project aimed to identify different shopper types for better personalization and marketing strategies.

**Highlights:**

- Preprocessed online retail transaction logs (removed duplicates, handled missing values)

- Applied Hierarchical Clustering to group users based on purchase frequency, recency, and monetary value (RFM analysis)

- Visualized dendrograms to determine optimal cluster separation

- Compared user clusters to identify loyal customers, discount-seekers, and one-time buyers

- Derived insights for targeted promotions and recommendation systems

**4. Smart City Sensor – Air Quality Clustering (Week 4)**

**Domain:** Environmental Data Science / Unsupervised Machine Learning
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, GeoPandas, PCA, K-Means, t-SNE
**Dataset:** Kaggle – Air Quality Dataset

**Description:**
Developed an unsupervised learning pipeline to analyze air pollution sensor data in a smart city setup. The project focused on preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization of pollution patterns to create sensor-based zones.

**Highlights:**

- Cleaned raw dataset (handled missing values -200, NaNs, duplicates)

- Applied StandardScaler + PCA (90% variance retained)

- Used K-Means clustering with Elbow & Silhouette methods to determine optimal cluster count

- Evaluated clusters using Silhouette Score & Davies–Bouldin Index

- Visualized clusters with PCA (2D), t-SNE (optional), and interactive Plotly

- Geo-mapped sensor clusters using GeoPandas when latitude/longitude were available

**Saved Outputs:**

- smart_city_sensor_clusters.csv → full dataset with cluster labels

- smart_city_sensor_cluster_summary.csv → cluster-wise mean pollutant levels

**Cluster Interpretation:**

- Cluster 0: Low pollution zones (cleaner air, safer for residential)

- Cluster 1: High pollution zones (industrial/traffic-heavy areas)

# 5. MNIST Digit Classifier (Week 5)

**Domain:** Computer Vision / Deep Learning
**Tools Used:** Python, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib
**Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits (60,000 train, 10,000 test images)

**Description:**
Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrated fundamental deep learning concepts including forward propagation, backpropagation, and softmax activation.

**Highlights:**

- Preprocessed grayscale images (28×28 pixels).

- Implemented ANN with input → hidden → output layers using Keras Sequential API.

- Used Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

- Trained with backpropagation & optimized using Adam.

- Achieved >97% accuracy on the test dataset.

- Visualized predictions with confusion matrix & sample digit outputs.
